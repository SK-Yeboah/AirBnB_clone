# AirBnB Clone

## Project Description

The AirBnB Clone project is a Python-based application that mimics certain functionalities of the AirBnB platform. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the application, allowing users to manage and manipulate data related to accommodations, bookings, and users.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial component of the AirBnB Clone project. It provides a shell-like interface where users can input commands to perform various operations within the application. The interpreter supports both interactive and non-interactive modes.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script:

```bash
$ ./console.p
